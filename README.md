# OrangeEngine
 This is my attempt at a game engine

 ##First commit: Added User Input
 I was able to add some user input into the project browser dialog so you have 3 buttons to play with. The top two buttons will interact with what the control panel will display and then the exit button.

##Second Commit: Added an Amimation
I added an animation such that as the user presses the buttons, the display will slide over.
